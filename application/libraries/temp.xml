    <longtext>Getto is a burger bar with a difference: each burger is named after a drag queen who performs there – keep an eye on the website if you're keen to catch an act. It describes itself as "an attitude-free zone, for gays, lesbians, bi, queers and straights". Relaxed and friendly, the bar staff mix great cocktails, and the interior has a chilled vibe. The burgers don't disappoint: try the Jennifer Hopelezz beef burger with guacamole and bacon, or the Dolly Bellefleur lamb burger with tzatziki and grilled courgette. They're served with chunky seasoned wedges and a mayo-heavy salad. And try the Gettopolitan – a cosmo made with Dutch Jenever liqueur.</longtext>

    <longtext>Tucked down the Nes – what looks like a back alley running south of Dam square – Van Kerkwijk is unprepossessing from outside, but inside it's habitually packed with customers at small wooden tables. They don\'t take reservations, so get there early and have a drink while you wait. There's no menu (in the ink-on-paper sense) so expect your waiter to recite a list of dishes. These range from French and Italian classics such as steak tartare and carpaccio, through to north African tagines and Indonesian curries. To start, try their house pâté, which is coarse, gamey and full of rustic French flavour. Van Kerkwijk's meat is generally good, with mercifully undercooked, well-seasoned steaks and generous, chunky chips.</longtext>
    <shorttext>Italien classics, come join the fun! Mains from €15. Open daily 11am-late</shorttext>

    <longtext>Don't go to de Zotte if you're teetotal. This "brown cafe" is a mecca for Belgian beer lovers, with several good brews on tap and scores more in bottles. To stop you getting too sozzled, a simple but filling menu is on offer. It's classic brown cafe fare: steaks with pepper, blue cheese or mushroom sauces, grilled lamb or chicken simply prepared. Non meat-eaters are also in for a treat: try De Zotte's hartige tart – essentially a deep-pan quiche. The filling changes, but generally involves some kind of cheese and green vegetables. It's huge, filling and feels like a hug on a cold day. Try it with sweet, dark bokbier on an autumn evening and breathe a contented sigh.</longtext>

    <longtext>The Anne Frank House (Dutch: Anne Frank Huis) is a historic house and biographical museum dedicated to Jewish wartime diarist Anne Frank. The building is located at the Prinsengracht, close to the Westerkerk, in the city center of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. During World War II, Anne Frank hid from Nazi persecution with her family and four other people in hidden rooms at the rear of the 17th-century canal house, known as the Secret Annex (Dutch: Achterhuis). Anne Frank did not survive the war, but in 1947 her wartime diary was published. In 1957, the Anne Frank Foundation was established to protect the property from developers who wanted to demolish the block. The museum opened on 3 May 1960. It preserves the hiding place, has a permanent exhibition on the life and times of Anne Frank, and has an exhibition space about all forms of persecution and discrimination.</longtext>
