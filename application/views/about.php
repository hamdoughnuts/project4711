                    For this project, we’ve dived right in and created a personalized website using CodeIginiter. For
                    the two of us, it’s our first time getting our hands dirty with Php. We decided to use the power of
                    Bootstrap and additional CSS3 libraries to style the web app.</p>

                <p class="whiteWords">Database :
                    For this particular web app, we’re going to stick to using the relational database to handle our
                    data. By using a relational database, we can entail that our data will be robust and full of
                    integrity. When we insert a row of data, we can expect that to be the last time we will do that
                    because the data only needs to be stored once, this is efficient and a much easier job to maintain
                    security</p>

                <p class="whiteWords">Management :
                    We turned to Github to manage how we will be working on the project, that way we won’t run into
                    terrible conflicts.</p>
